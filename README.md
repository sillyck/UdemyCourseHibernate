# UdemyCourseHibernate

This repository is dedicated to practicing **Hibernate** and **JPA** using **Spring Boot**. It contains examples and projects developed as part of a Udemy course on Hibernate and JPA.

## Description

In this repository, you will find examples of how to use **Hibernate** as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) along with the **Java Persistence API (JPA)** to manage databases efficiently. The project is built on **Spring Boot**, providing a fast and easy way to configure and start applications.

### Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: A framework for building Java applications quickly and easily.
- **Hibernate**: An ORM to simplify interaction with relational databases.
- **JPA**: Java API for managing persistence.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for rapid testing and development.

### Project Objectives

- Practice and understand how **Hibernate** and **JPA** work with **Spring Boot**.
- Implement examples of entity relationships such as **One-to-One**, **One-to-Many**, **Many-to-Many**, and inheritance.
- Learn concepts like **caching**, **criteria**, and **transactions** with Hibernate.

### How to Run the Project
